## Elysian
A self-hosted smart bookmark manager specially designed to sync your regularly used bookmarks from the bookmarks' bar of your browser to your home lab.

### How is it different from other similar services?
There are numerous other selfhosted services for bookmark management like Linkding, Linkwarden etc.

Those services are great. Elysian is primarily focused on backing up the bookmarks that reside in your browser's bookmarks bar and are used regularly.

Elysian comes with a browser extension which allows you to Import/Export bookmarks to your home lab. Once successfully connected to your home lab, and bookmarks exported, any operation you perform on your Browser's bookmarks (Create, Re-order, Update, Delete) will be automatically updated on the server side as well.

### Getting Started
Follow the steps mentioned on the [wiki](www.google.com) page to get Elysian up and running.

### Future Enhancements
 - Browser extension for Firefox (coming soon)
